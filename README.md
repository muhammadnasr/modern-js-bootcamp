# Modern JS Bootcamp

This project contains examples from [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/learn/lecture/9873002#overview) course from udemy. I made my own changes and enhancment to the project in this course (check git history for more details)


# Structure

 1. **examples** folder contains plain js examples with comments on modern js features
 3. **todo-app**, I reimplemented todo-app from the course using better coding practices such as Classes, short arrow functions and used [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) for building instead of web pack and babel. To run simple type `npm install` then `npm run start`
 4. **boilerplate-app**, inspired from todo-app, this gives a quick start for any new plain js app packed using Parcel
 5. **hangman-app**, same as the code the udemy course but using Parcel

## How to run

 - For apps type `npm install` then `npm run start`  
 - For basic and  advanced samples just type `node script-name.js`
